# Computer Science Projects Portfolio

This repository contains a collection of personal and technical projects submitted as part of a Masters in Computer Science application.

Some of the included projects were developed with the help of tools like ChatGPT and GitHub Copilot. All architectural decisions, integration, and overall design are my own. The `weather_program` project is entirely my own work with no AI assistance.
